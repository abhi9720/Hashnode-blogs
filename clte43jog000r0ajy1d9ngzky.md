## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of building a sophisticated Banking Portal API using Spring Boot, redis and MySQL. The API will provide essential functionalities for a banking application, including user registration, authentication, PIN management, and financial transactions. We'll also focus on security and data management best practices.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have:

* Basic knowledge of Java and the Spring Framework.
    
* A code editor of your choice (e.g., VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
    
* Postman (or a similar tool) for testing API endpoints.
    
* A MySQL database or any other relational database.
    

## Overview

Our objective is to create a powerful Banking Portal API that acts as a reliable backend for banking applications and financial services platforms. This API empowers users to execute essential banking operations, including account registration, login, PIN management, cash deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers between accounts.

## Technologies Used

We will use the following technologies and tools for building the API:

* **Spring Boot**: For rapid development and easy project setup.
    
* **Spring Security**: To handle user authentication and authorization.
    
* **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: For secure user authentication and token-based authorization.
    
* **MySQL Database**: To store user and transaction data.
    

## Key Features of the Banking Portal API

### 1\. User Registration and Account Creation

Allow users to register for an account by providing their name, email, address, and other necessary details. Upon successful registration, an associated account with a unique account number and balance will be created for the user.

### 2\. User Authentication with JWT

Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can log in with their account number and password, and upon successful login, they will receive a JWT token to authenticate future API requests.

### 3\. PIN Management

Enhance security with a PIN management system. Users can create and update their PINs for additional verification during financial transactions and account access.

### 4\. Cash Deposit

Allow users to deposit money into their accounts securely. The API will update the account balance and record the transaction history.

### 5\. Cash Withdrawal

Enable users to withdraw money from their accounts, ensuring sufficient balance and updating the account balance and transaction history accordingly.

### 6\. Fund Transfer

Facilitate fund transfers between accounts. Users can transfer money from their accounts to other accounts securely, updating account balances, and recording transaction histories for both sender and receiver.

### 7\. Error Handling

Implement custom exception handling to gracefully manage various error scenarios, providing appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages to clients.

### 8\. Token-Based Authorization

Token-based authorization using JWT ensures secure communication between the client and the server, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive operations.
